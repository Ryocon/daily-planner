# daily-planner


## Description
This project is a work day scheduler that uses multiple API's such as Bootstrap, Jquery and MomentJS to create a dynamic scheduler. Using MomentJS the page can be styled based on real time and will display the current date. Local storage is used to allow input written to each 'time block' to remain on the page even after refreshing.
